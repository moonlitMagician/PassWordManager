Incredibly basic and barebones password manager
Features:
  - Encrypted files stored for each password
  - ability to generate random and input your own passwords
  - all files stored locally so no risk of falling to an internet breach or something similar

DUE TO THE LOCAL NATURE OF PASSWORDS, PLEASE BACKUP ALL TEXT FILES TO A TRUSTED SOURCE!!!!!
